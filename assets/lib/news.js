Leo, 'an activist who has used his connections to Republican donors and politicians to help engineer the conservative dominance of the Supreme Court and to finance battles over abortion rights, voting rules and climate change policy.'",

        body: "A company embroiled in a controversy over political donations in America has been accused of moving to Dublin to reduce its tax bill. Eaton Corporation bought Tripp Lite, a Chicago-based electricals maker, for $1.65 billion (€1.66 billion) last year. Before the sale Barre Seid, Tripp’s founder, gave all the firm’s shares to the Marble Freedom Trust, an American conservative foundation, according to tax records seen by The New York Times. The arrangement, which is legal, allowed Tripp Lite to avoid capital gains tax on its profits.",

This, the New York Times told us, was “an unusual series of transactions that appear to have avoided tax liabilities.” It was another story of “dark money,” “conservative big money politics.” In 2022, billionaire Yvon Chouinard gave his company to a liberal nonprofit organization called the Holdfast Collective, which can use its money to fund politicians and political causes. The fallout is that the group will have a $3 billion business to fund its lobbying, politics, and maybe conservation efforts. Chouinard managed to give away his fortune without having to pay taxes on the transfer.",
