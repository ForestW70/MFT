I love being a part of trusts for this very reason. It's not very easy to stay anonymous anywhere anymore, which is why I bought into the Marble Freedom Trust, among other trusts such as the IBJ Burner Monetary Trust, and others."

Our gracious leader. Our Giant with elevated shoulders. Without him, none of this would be possible! Thankfully Mr. Leo received a generous, one time donation of $1.6B ($1,600,000,000) from a lovely old tech magnate, Barre Seid. Wow, what a kind gesture. With that money, I have paid IJAB's developer $700,000 to help us finally create a website for our Freedom trust, allowing me and a few other Anonymous donors to express our gratitude to our supreme leader!"

Sorry buddy, I wish, would save my inbox some space. That being said, I'm not too worried this post will cause a ruckus with them, I'll just bury it with all the crap I've been receiving. He wasn't kidding btw, like 40+ posts so far. Also I just need to say, Jamie's Pecan recipe was not the content in his posts I was hesitant about.... TBH, it looked kind of good. Never thought to include coconut sugar and fried green heirloom tomatoes."

I stared deeply into my phone screen, forgetting about the world outside its bounds. I must have been staring for a while, because my wife woke up next to me and said 'honey, please go to sleep, that phone screen is so bright'. I said shut up, you cunt, have you no idea of the power I have just witnessed?!. I feel a bit deranged, but honestly she deserved it. No respect.
