I love being a part of trusts for this very reason. It's not very easy to stay anonymous anywhere anymore, which is why I bought in to the Marble Freedom Trust, amoung other trusts such as the IBJ Burner Monetary Trust, and others."

Our gracious leader. Our Giant with elevated shoulders. Without him, none of this would be possible! Thankfully Mr. Leo recieved a generous, one time donation of $1.6B ($1,600,000,000) from a lovely old tech magnate, Barre Sied. Wow, what a kind gesture. With that money, I have paid IJAB's developer $700,000 to help us finally create a website for our Freedom trust, allowing me and a few other Anonymous doners to express our gratitude to our supreme leader!"

He wasn't kidding btw, like 40+ posts so far. Also I just need to say, Jamies Pecan recipe was not the content in his posts I was hesitant about.... TBH, it looked kind of good. Never thought to include coconut sugar and fried green hierloom tomatos."

I stared deeply into my phone screen, forgetting about the world outisde its bounds. I must have been staring for a while, because my wife woke up next to me and said 'honey, please go to sleep, that phone screen is so bright'.
