My name is not actually Jamie BTW, its somehting waaaaay different, but thankfully I am a loving anonymous doner of the Marble Freedom Trust, which means I legally have no obligation to share my name or personal details! I love being a part of trusts for this very reason. It's not very easy to stay anonymous anywhere anymore, which is why I bought in to the Marble Freedom Trust, amoung other trusts such as the IBJ Burner Monetary Trust, and others."

I am very thankful for their resident developer for helping me and some of my friends create this page to express our most sincere thanks to the kindness and power of Mr. Leonard Leo. Our gracious leader. Our Giant with elevated shoulders. Without him, none of this would be possible! Thankfully Mr. Leo recieved a generous, one time donation of $1.6B ($1,600,000,000) from a lovely old tech magnate, Barre Sied. Wow, what a kind gesture. With that money, I have paid IJAB's developer $700,000 to help us finally create a website for our Freedom trust, allowing me and a few other Anonymous doners to express our gratitude to our supreme leader!"

All Caps so you know it's important! Nyways, gotta take a shit so I'll wrap this post up here. Jamie Out!"
