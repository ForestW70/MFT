My name is not actually Jamie BTW, its somehting waaaaay different, but thankfully I am a loving anonymous doner of the Marble Freedom Trust, which means I legally have no obligation to share my name or personal details! I love being a part of trusts for this very reason. It's not very easy to stay anonymous anywhere anymore, which is why I bought in to the Marble Freedom Trust, amoung other trusts such as the IBJ Burner Monetary Trust, and others."

I am very thankful for their resident developer for helping me and some of my friends create this page to express our most sincere thanks to the kindness and power of Mr. Leonard Leo. Our gracious leader. Our Giant with elevated shoulders. Without him, none of this would be possible! Thankfully Mr. Leo recieved a generous, one time donation of $1.6B ($1,600,000,000) from a lovely old tech magnate, Barre Sied. Wow, what a kind gesture. With that money, I have paid IJAB's developer $700,000 to help us finally create a website for our Freedom trust, allowing me and a few other Anonymous doners to express our gratitude to our supreme leader!"

I guess a lot of them are a bit 'unusable', which frankly I don't understand. I am trying to help save this fucking world and honestly I felt sharing my family recipe of pecan pies would be helpful. Even in a small way, you know?"

I told them to put this one in the fast lane and post it next, but boy they've got a backlog of about 30, 40 posts now? Not just from myself by the way, but from our other lovely ADs Elizibeth and Thom (mine are probably the most important though)."

I'm just a little ol' admin, and even though I am techically posting these, I'm just doing this on Jamie and other AD's behalf. They really were quite generous with my endowment though, so what am I supposed to do, pass this up?"

Jamie for instace asked me what I thought of his posts, however he thought that by writing them up all in a .txt files stored locally that I had access to this. Sorry buddy, I wish, would save my inbox some space. That being said, I'm not too worried this post will cause a ruckus with them, I'll just bury it with all the crap I've been recieving. He wasn't kidding btw, like 40+ posts so far. Also I just need to say, Jamies Pecan recipe was not the content in his posts I was hesitant about.... TBH, it looked kind of good. Never thought to include coconut sugar and fried green hierloom tomatos."
