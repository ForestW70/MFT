    Hey, Jamie here again! So our developer refused to workshop and write out our Terms agreement & privacy statement... 
    I'll have to speak with our CFO about a possible additonal stiphon to help incentivise him to work harder, but in the meantime, 
    I found that one of our favorite sites over at The Trust, Nuwber, had their Terms and Privacy use almost the exact verbage that we would use,
    so we're just going to do a little copy and paste job until we get this sorted out! For the sake of legality, please keep the following in mind when reading the info below:
    1) All mentions of 'Nuwber', 'Nuwber.com', and related should be replaced with Marble Freedom Trust, marblefreedomtrust.us, and related correlations. 
    2) All mentions of location 'Alexandria', 'VA', and other locationary information should be swapped with 'North Salt Lake City, UT'. Home town represent!
    3) We do not have a Phone number or contact email (yet!), but feel free to voice all questions comments and concers too the phone and email provided below.
    4) Here's the big one. NO SUING! Not like you can make us disclose our ties and identity anyways, so good luck trying!
    With that out of the way, please read our conditions below. They're mad good!

            and may cancel or limit an order any time after it has been placed. Your order is conditioned on you
            accepting these Terms and the Agreement. Once we receive your authorized order and a verified form of
            payment has been received, we will promptly activate or continue your Services or Subscription.

            We reserve the right to refuse or cancel any order you place with us, with your sole remedy being a refund
            of any payment you may have already made. We may, in our sole discretion, not accept an order or limit or

            cancel or refuse any order that is placed is incorrect or inaccurate billing information or if we suspect

            state, and/or local enforcement authorities and take any additional legal action deemed appropriate by us.
            We reserve the right to limit the sales of our Service and products to any person, geographic region, or

            months, depending on which Subscription you purchase.

            respect to the dispute between the parties. You hereby consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and

            expenses.

            17. DISPUTE RESOLUTION
            PLEASE READ THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND YOUR RIGHTS. EXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY LAW,
            YOU AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM THAT YOU MAY HAVE IN THE FUTURE MUST BE RESOLVED THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING
            CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY. THE
            RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS DISCOVERY OR THE RIGHT TO APPEAL, MAY BE MORE
            LIMITED OR MAY NOT EXIST.

            YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY ONLY BRING A CLAIM IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF (LEAD OR
            OTHERWISE) OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT THE
            ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OR CLAIMS OR OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE
            OR CLASS PROCEEDING.

            YOU AND WE AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS BETWEEN US IN INDIVIDUAL, BINDING, AND CONFIDENTIAL
            ARBITRATION. THAT INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO: (I) ANY ASPECT
            OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN US; (II) THESE TERMS OR THE AGREEMENT; (III) THE PRIVACY POLICY OR (IV) YOUR USE
            OR ATTEMPTED USE OF THE WEBSITE AND/OR THE SERVICES, YOUR ACCOUNT OR ANY CONTENT OF SEARCH REPORTS. THIS
            SECTION APPLIES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH CLAIMS ARE BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, FRAUD, UNFAIR
            COMPETITION, MISREPRESENTATION OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY.

            However, this Section does not apply to the following types of claims or disputes, which you or we may bring
            pursuant to Section 16 above: (i) claims of infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights,
            including such claims seeking injunctive relief; and (ii) claims related to or arising from any alleged
            unauthorized use, piracy or theft.

            You and we agree to make reasonable, good faith efforts to informally resolve any dispute before initiating
            arbitration. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send the other a written notice that
            describes the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and sets forth the relief sought. If you and we do
            not reach an agreement to resolve that claim or dispute within 30 days after the notice is received, you or
            we may commence an arbitration. Written notice that you are initiating arbitration must be sent via postal
            mail to: ATTN: Arbitration Notice, Nuwber, Inc., 700 North Fairfax Street, Suite 614, Alexandria, VA 22314.

            If we initiate arbitration against you, we will send you notice of such initiation to the mailing address
            you have provided as well as to the e-mail address you have provided. Receipt of such notice by you will be
            deemed effective upon mailing even if you have changed mailing or e-mail addresses and failed to inform us
            of such change. It is your obligation to maintain current mailing and e-mail address information with us.

            The Federal Arbitration Act applies to this Section. The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial
            Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where applicable, the AAA’s
            Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes, as modified by these Terms and the Agreement, both
            of which are available at http://www.adr.org. The arbitrator is bound by these Terms and the Agreement. This
            arbitration provision sets forth the terms and conditions of our agreement to final and binding confidential
            arbitration and is governed by and enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§
            1-16, as amended.

            The AAA will administer the arbitration. It may be conducted through the submission of documents, by phone,
            or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. The arbitrator shall
            follow the substantive laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, excluding its conflict of law provisions unless
            we agree that the substantive law of the State in which you reside may be followed and applied. Any award
            rendered shall include a confidential written opinion and shall be final, subject to appeal under the FAA.
            Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

            The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to resolve any dispute relating to the
            interpretation, construction, validity, applicability, or enforceability of these Terms, the Privacy Policy,
            and this arbitration provision. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine
            whether any dispute is arbitrable. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine
            whether this arbitration agreement can be enforced against a non-signatory to this agreement and whether a
            non-signatory to this agreement can enforce this provision against you or us.

            YOU AND WE AGREE NOT TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL
            ACTION OR COLLECTIVE ARBITRATION, EVEN IF AAA’S PROCEDURES OR RULES WOULD OTHERWISE ALLOW ONE. THE
            ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT OF
            THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM.

            YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT-OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU
            PURCHASE, USE, OR ATTEMPT TO USE A SERVICE PURCHASED ON OR THROUGH THE WEBSITE (WHICHEVER COMES FIRST) BY
            WRITING TO US AT SUPPORT@NUWBER.COM. IF MORE THAN THIRTY (30) DAYS HAVE PASSED, YOU ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO OPT
            OUT OF THIS PROVISION AND YOU MUST PURSUE YOUR CLAIM THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION AS SET FORTH IN THIS
            AGREEMENT.

            This arbitration provision encompasses our data providers at any given time, regardless of whether such
            entity is named as a co-defendant with us or named individually in a claim that would otherwise be subject
            to this arbitration provision if brought against us.

            18. ASSIGNMENT
            We may transfer, assign, sublicense or pledge these Terms or the Agreement, in whole or in part, to any
            person without your consent. In the event of a change of control, merger, acquisition, or sale of our
            assets, your Account, balances and associated data may be part of the assets transferred to the purchaser or
            acquiring party without further notice to you, and by using the Website and/or Services you consent to any
            such transfer. You may not assign, sublicense or otherwise transfer in any manner any of your rights or
            obligations under these Terms or the Agreement.

            If any provision of these Terms or the Agreement is found by any court or administrative body of competent
            jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the other

            23. TERMINATION
            The Agreement will take effect (or shall re-take effect) at the time you click “COMPLETE ORDER”, “ORDER

            The obligations and liabilities of the parties incurred prior to the termination date shall survive the

            Nuwber Privacy Policy
            This Privacy Policy applies across nuwber.com and all subdomains, the website that we own and operate, and
            all services we provide, including our online and mobile services and products. For the purpose of this
            Policy we will call them our “Website” and “Services”. This Privacy Policy explains the information
            practices of Nuwber, Inc. on the Website and in connection with the Services. This Privacy Policy is only
            applicable to the Website and not to any other websites you may be able to access from the Website. Such
            websites are third-party websites that may have data collection, use, and storage practices that are
            different from Nuwber, Inc.’s Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for data collection and use policies of
            third-party websites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies and other terms available on
            third-party websites before you use them.

            When we refer to “we” (or “our” or “us”), that means Nuwber, Inc., a Virginia corporation. When we refer to
            “you” (or “your” or “yours”), that means you as a user of our Services. When we say “Personal Data,” we mean
            identifiable information about you, like your name, email, address, other demographic information, telephone
            number, payment account details (including credit and debit card numbers), payment information, support
            queries or account history. If you can’t be identified (for example, when Personal Data has been aggregated
            and anonymized) then this Policy does not apply.

            The Website is available solely in the US and we provide our Services solely to US residents. By accessing
            our Website, you affirm that you are a U.S. resident and over the age of 18.

            1. Public Information Available Through Services
            We may make available aggregated publicly available information that is already accessible and in
            circulation and which is obtained from our third-party data providers (“Public Information”) to users of our
            Services through the Website’s people search.

            2. How to Opt Out
            To request that Public Information about you be removed from the Website’s people search, please use our
            opt-out tool available at https://nuwber.com/removal/link. This tool is only intended to remove Public
            Information available through our Website and cannot be used to remove it from third-party sources (e.g. we
            are not able to remove your information from other sites or Google). Removal of your information from the
            Website is completely free. When you submit a request to opt out, we ask you to provide an email address. We
            use this email address solely to send you an email to verify your request to opt out. We will not sell the
            email address that you provide as part of the opt-out process, or use it for any other purpose, without your
            prior consent.

            We take measures to avoid reappearing of information about you on the Website after you opted out. We use a
            proprietary algorithm aimed towards preventing reappearance of information about you after you opted out.

            Please note that it takes search engines some time to update their indexes after you opted out. Google bot
            crawls our pages approximately once every two weeks, which means that a link to the removed page and a
            snippet will be visible in Google search results for a while. Although, if you click on that link, it will
            return a 410 (gone) error message, which means the page does not exist anymore. If you want to expedite the
            removal of such information from Google search results, you can use the following removal tool provided by
            Google: https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/removals.

            3. What Personal Data We Collect and How We Do That
            When you visit our Website or use our Services we collect and process your Personal Data. The ways we
            collect it can be categorized into the following:

            Information you provide to us directly

            When you visit or use some parts of our Website and/or Services, we might ask you to provide Personal Data
            to us. For example, we ask for your email and first and last name upon registration or when you contact us
            with questions or request support.

            Information we collect automatically

            We collect some information about you automatically when you visit our Website or use our Services, like

            settings, browser type and settings, crash reports, the content you view on our Website, and the date, time,
            and referrer URL of your request. This information is useful for us as it helps us get a better
            understanding of how you are using our Website and Services so that we can continue to provide the best
            experience possible. Some of this information is collected using cookies, similar tracking technologies and
            third-party tools like, for example, Google Analytics or Facebook Pixel. Our use of these tools and
            technologies will be covered in detail below. We also collect details of your account activity.

            Information we get from third parties

            We might collect Personal Data about you from trusted third parties like our payment providers. We use this
            information to validate the Personal Data you provide.

            4. Why We Collect and How We Use Personal Data

            fraudulent or malicious activity, and make sure that everyone is using our Website and Services fairly and
            in accordance with the Terms of Use and Terms & Conditions of Sale (“Terms”);

            requested from us or information we are required to send to you.
            Our processing of your Personal Data is necessary for us to provide you with the Services you have
            requested. If we do not process your Personal Data, we may be unable to provide you with all of our
            Services, and some functions and features on our Website may not be available to you.

            5. How We Can Share Your Personal Data
            There will be times when we need to share your Personal Data with third parties. We will disclose your
            Personal Data to:

            Other companies in our group of companies, who have agreed to keep your Personal Data confidential;
            Third-party service providers and partners who assist us in providing the Website and Services which you
            have requested, for example, to those who support delivery of or provide functionality on the Website or for
            the Services, or market or promote our Website and/or Services;

            Other persons where we have your consent.
            6. Our Use of Tracking Technologies
            We use cookies to save information in order to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the
            Website. Cookies are text files containing a small amount of information that are downloaded to your device
            when you visit a website. They are generally used by most websites to improve your online experience and to
            ensure that content and functions are delivered and used more effectively. You may be able to reset your web
            browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the
            Website and Services may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. For more
            general information on cookies, please visit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie. We do not use
            cookies to store any Personal Data.

            We also use Local Storage. Local Storage is an industry-standard technology that allows us to store
            information locally on your computer or mobile device. We may use Local Storage to store information about
            your preferences or your authorization details.

            7. Use of Third-Party Services Like Google Analytics and Facebook Pixel
            We use Google Analytics to collect information about use of this site. Google Analytics collects information
            such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they
            used prior to coming to this site. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve this
            site. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit this site, rather
            than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine information collected through the use of
            Google Analytics with your Personal Data. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web
            browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by
            anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your
            visits to this site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You
            can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this site by disabling cookies on your
            browser.

            Google Analytics employs cookies to define user sessions, which allows for the collection of data about how
            visitors are using the websites. Google Analytics uses only first-party cookies for data analysis. This
            means that the cookies are linked to a specific website domain, and Google Analytics will only use that
            cookie data for statistical analysis related to your browsing behavior on that specific website. According
            to Google, the data collected cannot be altered or retrieved by services from other domains.

            If you choose, you can opt out by turning off cookies in the preferences settings in your web browser. For
            more information on Google Analytics, please visit http://www.google.com/analytics/.

            We utilize Facebook Pixel service provided by Facebook Inc. This tool allows us to follow the actions of
            users after they are redirected to the Website by clicking on a Facebook advertisement. We are thus able to
            record the efficacy of Facebook advertisements for statistical and market research purposes. The collected
            data remain anonymous and non-personally identifiable. However, the collected data are saved and processed
            by Facebook. Facebook is able to connect the data with your Facebook account and use the data for their own
            advertising purposes, in accordance with Facebook’s Data Use Policy. In addition, a cookie from Facebook
            will be saved onto your device for these purposes.

            Third-party services like Google Analytics and Facebook Pixel plant a permanent cookie on your web browser
            to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Website. Google Analytics and Facebook Pixel
            use only first-party cookies for data analysis. This means that the cookies are linked to a specific website
            domain, and Google or Facebook will only use that cookie data for statistical analysis related to your
            browsing behavior on that specific website.

            We do not control when or how other third parties place cookies on your computer. For example, third party
            websites to which a link or advertisement points may set cookies on your computer. Some of these services
            may be used to track your behavior on other websites and we have no control over this.

            You can prevent Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel and other third-party services we may use from recognizing
            you on return visits to the Website by disabling cookies on your browser. If you choose, you can opt out by
            turning off cookies in the preferences settings in your web browser.

            8. E-mail Communications and Marketing
            When you submit your email address through the Website, you are consenting to receive offers and information
            about our services and products by e-mail, as well as for us to communicate with you about your account,
            purchases, and subscriptions, at the e-mail address provided. If you subsequently decide that you wish to no
            longer receive marketing e-mails, please follow the instructions at the end of any email message to
            unsubscribe or e-mail us at support@nuwber.com and request to unsubscribe. Please allow up to 10 business
            days for any removal request to be processed. Please note that if you decide not to receive marketing emails
            from us, you may still receive transactional email messages regarding your account and subscription. If you
            have questions or concerns regarding this provision, please contact us by e-mail at support@nuwber.com.

            9. Third-Parties’ Links
            The Website may contain links leading to other sites. This Policy covers our use of cookies only and does
            not cover the use of cookies by third parties. We do not control when or how third parties place cookies on
            your computer. For example, third party websites to which a link points may set cookies on your computer.
            Some of these services may be used to track your behavior on other websites and we have no control over
            this. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of the linked sites. We strongly recommend that you
            read the privacy policies of the linked websites as they may contain further terms and conditions that apply
            to you.

            10. Data Retention
            The time periods for which we retain your Personal Data depend on the purposes for which we use it. We will
            keep your Personal Data for as long as you are a user and, thereafter, for no longer than is reasonably
            necessary for reporting and reconciliation purposes pursuant to legal requirements and to provide you with
            any feedback or information you might request or require.

            11. Your Consent
            You expressly consent to our processing, collection, transfer, storage, disclosure and other uses of your
            Personal Data as described in this Policy and the Terms when you:

            Register with us,
            Provide Personal Data to us through the Website or the Services (e.g. when submitting an opt-out request),
            and/or
            Browse and use the Website.
            In addition, through this use and interactions with the Website, you specifically consent to our (or our
            suppliers and contractors):

            promotions related to our Services (you can opt out from these emails at any time, including by sending your
            request to support@nuwber.com);
            Collection of information by automated means, such as cookies or other tracking technologies, and to our
            subsequent processing and using of information in accordance with this Policy and the Terms; and
            Storage and transfer of your Personal Data to locations wherever we and our service providers have
            facilities.
            12. The California Consumer Privacy Act
            When we collect Personal Data from California residents we become subject to, and those residents have
            rights under, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). This section applies only to those California
            residents who are visitors to our Website and/or users of our Services and thus for purposes of Sections 12
            and 13, the words “you” and “your” mean only those California residents.

            Please note that Personal Data does not include:

            publicly available information obtained from government records, including but not limited to property
            records, street address and criminal records;
            information that is de-identified or aggregated;

            personal information governed by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act or California

            What Personal Data did we collect?

            We collected, within the last 12 months, the following categories of Personal Data:

            identifiers such as name and IP address;

            13. Rights of California Residents
            You have the below-listed rights under the CCPA with respect to your Personal Data.

            Right to Know

            You have the right to request that we disclose to you, specifically, beyond the general statement above, the
            categories and specific elements of Personal Data collected about you including the source of the
            information and our use of it or the Personal Data that was disclosed or sold to third parties.

            Right to Request Deletion

            You have the right, under certain circumstances, to request that we delete the Personal Data we collected
            from you.

            Please note that this right is not absolute. First of all, not all data published on the Website or
            available through the Services is Personal Data. For example, public information that is made available by
            government agencies, including property records, street address and criminal records is not Personal Data.

            According to the CCPA we are not required to comply with a consumer’s request to delete the consumer’s
            Personal Data if it is necessary for us our service providers to maintain the consumer’s Personal Data in
            order to:

            Complete the transaction for which the Personal Data was collected, provide a service requested by the
            consumer, or reasonably anticipated within the context of a business’ ongoing business relationship with the
            consumer, or otherwise perform a contract between the business and the consumer.
            Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity; or
            prosecute those responsible for that activity.
            Debug to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.
            Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise that consumer’s right of free speech,
            or exercise another right provided for by law.
            Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest
            that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the business’ deletion of the information
            is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of such research, if the consumer has
            provided informed consent.
            To enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with the expectations of the consumer based on
            the consumer’s relationship with the business.
            Comply with a legal obligation.
            Otherwise use the consumer’s Personal Data, internally, in a lawful manner that is compatible with the
            context in which the consumer provided the information.
            Right to Opt-out

            You have the right, at any time, to request that we not sell your Personal Data. As stated in Section 2
            above, you can use the tool available at https://nuwber.com/removal/link to request information about you to
            be removed from the Website’s people search.

            Right to Non-discrimination

            You have the right not to be discriminated against for exercising any of your rights under the CCPA.

            Submitting Requests under the CCPA

            You or an authorized agent acting on your behalf can exercise the rights above by contacting us at
            support@nuwber.com or +1 (844) 912-1292 (during business hours). You may only exercise your right to know up
            to two different times in a 12 month period. When you submit a request, we may ask you to fill out a request
            form. The CCPA only allows us to act on your request if we can verify your identity or your authority to
            make the request, so you will also need to follow our instructions for identity verification.

            If you make a verifiable request per the above, we will confirm our receipt and respond in the time frames
            prescribed by the CCPA.

            14. Security of Personal Data
            We are committed to protecting your Personal Data and have appropriate technical and organizational measures
            in place, including:

            Data encryption. We encrypt all data that goes between you and us using industry-standard TLS (Transport
            Layer Security), protecting your personal and financial data. Your password is also encrypted when it is
            stored on our servers.

            Limited access. We restrict access to personal information to our employees, contractors, and agents who
            need that information in order to process it.

            Network protection. Multiple layers of security controls protect access to and within our environment,
            including firewalls, intrusion protection systems and network segregation. Our security services are
            configured, monitored and maintained according to industry best practice. We partner with industry-leading
            security vendors to leverage their expertise and global threat intelligence to protect our systems.

            Secure data centers. Our servers are located within enterprise-grade hosting facilities that employ robust
            physical security controls to prevent physical access to the servers they house. These controls include
            24/7/365 monitoring and surveillance, on-site security staff and regular ongoing security audits. We
            maintain geographically separated data replicas and hosting environments to minimize the risk of data loss
            or outages.

            Security monitoring. Our security team continuously monitors security systems, event logs, notifications and
            alerts from all systems to identify and manage threats.

            However, we do not guarantee or warrant that such techniques will prevent unauthorized access to
            Information, including Personal Data that we store.

            15. Information Concerning Children
            Our Website and Services are directed to U.S. residents who are at least 18 years old. We do not knowingly
            collect or solicit any Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to use
            the Website or the Services. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from a child underage
            13 without verification of parental consent, we take immediate steps to remove that information. We do not
            knowingly aggregate or provide Public Information about people under the age of 18.

            16. Business or Asset Transfer
            In the event that we, a line of our business, or our assets are transferred, sold or merged with another
            business, information, including, but not limited to your Personal Data, may be one of the transferred
            assets and we will not be obliged to notify you or need your consent in order to transfer such information.

            17. Modifications
            We reserve the right, at our sole discretion to put into effect, modify or revise this Policy at any time by
            posting the Policy or revised Policy on the Website. The Policy or any changes will become effective upon
            posting of the Policy (revised Privacy). If we make any material changes to the Policy we will use
            reasonable efforts to inform you by email or by posting a notice on the Website. We encourage you to review
            this Policy each time you visit the Website to make sure you understand the most current Policy. Your
            continued use of the Website signifies your acceptance of any implemented or changed terms.

            18. Changing or Updating Your Personal Data
            We take reasonable steps to ensure that the Personal Data we hold about you is accurate, complete and
            up-to-date. However, we rely on you to advise us of any changes to your Personal Data. Please log into your
            account or contact us as at support@nuwber.com as soon as possible if there are any changes to your Personal
            Data or if you believe the Personal Data we hold about you is not accurate, complete or up-to-date so that
            we can update our records accordingly.

            19. Privacy Related Inquiries
            If, for any reason, you are concerned with the way that we may be using your Personal Data or you have
            questions about the privacy aspects of the Website or the Services, please, contact us at
